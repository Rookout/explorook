Rookout is a data extraction and pipelining platform, which provides the ability to collect any piece of data from live code, on-demand, using non-breaking breakpoints (Learn more about Rookout on our [website](https://www.rookout.com) or our [docs pages](https://docs.rookout.com)).

The Rookout desktop app ("explorook") allows you to navigate through your local projects in a simple and flexible manner. Use this app in combination with the Rookout web debugger to set non-breaking breakpoints in your source files, and to instantly apply them to live code.

- Ease of use - set up once and easily access any directory or file you choose directly from the browser. No need to manually open or refresh files and folders; no additional privileges needed.
- Git aware - seamlessly access your source code across all devices where the app is installed, regardless of the local paths to which you’ve cloned a git repository to. Easily collaborate with fellow developers working on the same code base. 
- Security- maintain strict control over the files you open for sharing and the websites that can access them. Rookout will never collect or modify your source code. 

## Security

At Rookout we take your source code security very seriously. Rookout will never collect or modify your source code. 

The Rookout Desktop App was designed with security as a foremost concern, its security features are as follows:
- The App only listens for connections from localhost.
- The App only allows access from the Rookout app.

## Installation

The desktop app can be installed from within the Rookout web UI, such as when initially selecting a project and indicating use of local code. A link is offered to download the app (which will be customized to your operating system, and which will offer the latest available installer for the Rookout Desktop App). Here's a brief video of that workflow:
